# e-com-web
A very basic UI I made a about a year ago for an internship involving HTML and CSS.
It is an interface for an e-commerce website.

## What is in it?
A few webpages linked together, meant to demonstrate a few cool CSS tricks and transitions.
Currently, you can only add one item to the cart.

## How to go about it
Clone this repo.
Open up `home.htm` (or any other `.htm` file) to navigate between the webpages.
Simple.

### Additionally
There is a command based version too, written in python3. Albeit it is very elementary.
